Not for me.

Yes, it was too long, but I have read longer books and enjoyed them. This one was too long because it spent like 400 pages wallowing in some neckbeard power fantasy. Half the book was interesting historical fiction, the other half was extreme cringe. It's like if you took the people that complain about female main characters in video games and asked them to write a fantasy about saving the president. It was horrendously white-knighty. 

All female characters in this book exist to get beaten to make the 6ft5 main character look like a badass as he walks around saying things like "\[I'm\] Charlie fucking Chaplin. I went to France just to see the ladies dance. Now get out of here" or pedantically correcting grammar mistakes.

- George can swing dance so well the whole high school claps
- George can pluck heartstrings to turn football players into actors
- George can woo curmudgeonly old ladies in any Texan small town
- George can make people cry with gratitude with a simple sentence
- George is the world's greatest lover
- George can woo women by licking the insides of their mouths?????

Man. The time travel could have been way cooler, but it was like 100 pages of interesting historical science fiction and then 500 pages of some boring-ass Gary Stu flexing on the unsuspecting residents of some ~~podunk~~[^1] Texan town.

[^1]: Edited out 'cause I actually like Sadie and the residents of Jodie. I just hate that they were used as wooden props in Jake/George/King's man-fantasy.
