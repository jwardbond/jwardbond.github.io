Ask people good questions. Reframe and repeat what they are saying back to them. Create moments of shared vulnerability. Understand the goal of whatever conversation you are having. Mirror emotional cues (and try not to look like a sociopath). Build common ground during difficult conversations.

Throw in some convenient, Malcolm Gladwell -style anecdotes (which were admittedly fun to learn about) and some "Researchers at Harvard and Other Universities" and there you go.
