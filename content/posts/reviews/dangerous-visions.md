summary: A Hex upon the Indigo employee that convinced me to buy not just this long-ass book, but its two long-ass sequels as well (which I've since returned).

None of these visions seem particularly dangerous, in the black-mirror-era. The couple short stories that I liked were the ones that were stylistically quite different. 

Good stories: 
If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?
Sex and/or Mr. Morrison
Incident in Moderan
The Escaping
Aye, and Gomorrah

Bad stories:
Most of the remainder, with a special shout out to "Ersatz"
