Chalk this one up under the "are these women crazy or do they just vehemently realize their autonomy and reject the (patriarchal) trappings of modern life?" category of books that I have read, which also includes

- Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 (also Korean!)
- The Awakening
- The Bell Jar
- Nightbitch (okay I only watched the movie on a plane but it still counts)

This book did not bring much to the table for me from a big-overarching-message perspective, but I did really enjoy the eerie weirdness - lots of "wait... what?" moments in here - and I love the above-mentioned conceit. The translation was very well done.

I have been practicing hand stands, they are extremely hard.
