Exceeded expectations.

I dream of one day being able to see the small ironies that make up peoples' worldviews with the clarity with which CS Lewis does. It's both celebratory and accusatory. These little disconnects we hold at the heart of ourselves make us confusing, make us idiots, good and bad people, all at once, and they make us Human.

They also make us frustrating prey for Demons, apparently.

Oddly enough reminded me a bit of David Foster-Wallace's writing. I think because both hyper-fixate on the quirks of human existence, hyper-analyzing them until the banal becomes bizarre becomes hilarious.
