summary: I've recently discovered that progression fantasy books are crack to me 
---
Consider this my review for the whole series (up to book 7 so far)

I've recently discovered that progression fantasy books are crack to me (which probably explains why I love The Wheel of Time). I get so addicted to them, I forget to socialize. I take my e-reader everywhere I go just incase I have a spare 30s when waiting in line to use the bathroom or something. These are the perfect vacation books, but I have to be careful not to waste too much time on them when I return to real life.

This series is definitely more juvenile than the fantasy series I am used to, and you can tell it was started on some fanfic website at some point. The characters are ridiculous and campy. The plot has a million holes. Deus-ex are abundant. Still, I'll be damned if I didn't love them. 

Not sure what sort of RNG system the author uses to come up with all these wild ideas, but he must have one.
