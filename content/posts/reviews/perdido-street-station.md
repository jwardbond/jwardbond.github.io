summary: It's like saying "I'm tired of everyone talking about American food, there is more to food than that! So here is my Thai-Nigerian-Mexican-Japanese-Canadian-inspired ground beef patty sandwich. Just a confused hamburger.

The opening of the book was *fantastic*. I almost shivered with anticipation of the weird horrors that were about to unfold. Unfortunately the rest of the book was a bit of a let-down.

I read somewhere that the author is deliberately trying to take fantasy in new directions. This did not feel like a new direction, but rather 700 old directions at once. There is way too much going on in this book. Sure, many of the ideas are wildly creative, but they only serve to hide a rather weak/thin and run-of-the-mill plot.

How did they keep going to kill the moths but leaving before they are done. I felt like I read the same subplot 5 times in a row.
