summary: Yes, it was too long, but I have read longer books and enjoyed them. This one was too long because it spent like 400 pages wallowing in some neckbeard power fantasy.

This is one of the best books I've ever read. I want to go back through it with a highlighter and sticky notes because it is so full of practical, non-partisan advice for how to construct a meaningful and participatory democracy. 

Too many people think democracy starts and ends with on an election day, and Dave Meslin shows you how *untrue* that is. How that is a way of thinking that has been drilled into you by governments that passively and actively try to exclude you from decision-making. This book shows you how you can have a voice, not just a vote.

Reading this book filled me with so much hope. The world Dave Meslin envisions is a beautiful one, and he shows you how *you* can help it get there. I would consider this essential reading for anyone remoted interested in political participation.
